This is a repo for refactoring machine unlearning framework, SISA.

Data source: 
- ml-100k from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
- mnist from https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html

TODO:
- refactor SISA from original repo
- Apply SISA to classification problem with NN (MNIST)
- Apply SISA to classification problem with KNN (ml-100k)
- Deploy SISA on seperate servers on AWS
